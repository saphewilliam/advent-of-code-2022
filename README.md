# Advent of Code 2022

To run the code of a (set of) day(s), run `make D="<space delimited string of day numbers>"`. To only run the test inputs for those days, add a 0 to the days argument.

For example: 
- `make D=3` runs the solution code for day 3
- `make D="1 2 5"` runs the solution code for days 1, 2, and 5
- `make D="0 2 4"` runs the solution code for only the test inputs of days 2 and 4.
